## Log Entries

### VL0001
- **Time**: 20:30
- **Date**: 2024-06-28
- **Vibe Summary**: Initial project setup and GitHub integration. Setting up PPNotes as a Personal & Private voice notes app using on-device LLM technology.
- **Achievement**: 
  - ✅ Connected Xcode project to GitHub repository
  - ✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore for iOS development
  - ✅ Resolved merge conflicts between local and remote repos
  - ✅ Updated README.md to reflect voice notes app concept
  - ✅ Added README.md to Xcode project navigator
- **Lesson Learnt**: When connecting existing local project to GitHub repo with initial files, use `--allow-unrelated-histories` and be prepared to resolve merge conflicts. Xcode project.pbxproj can be manually edited to add files to project navigator.

### VL0002
- **Time**: 21:15
- **Date**: 2024-06-28
- **Vibe Summary**: App design phase following Apple Human Interface Guidelines. Focus on push-to-talk recording interaction and voice note cards layout with time limits and user feedback.
- **Achievement**: 
  - ✅ Created comprehensive design document in README.md
  - ✅ Designed push-to-talk recording button with proper HIG compliance
  - ✅ Specified voice note card layout (staggered sticky-note style)
  - ✅ Defined 3-minute recording limit with progressive warnings
  - ✅ Added vibration feedback at 10 seconds remaining
  - ✅ Designed accessibility features (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, Motor accessibility)
  - ✅ Specified color system, typography, and animation principles
  - ✅ Created detailed interaction flows and UI specifications
- **Lesson Learnt**: Following Apple HIG early in design phase prevents rework later. Breaking down complex interactions (like recording states) into clear visual and haptic feedback stages creates better UX. Recording time limits need progressive warnings rather than sudden cut-offs. Accessibility considerations should be designed in, not added later.

### VL0003
- **Time**: 22:00
- **Date**: 2024-06-28
- **Vibe Summary**: Complete app implementation from design to functional PPNotes app. Built all core components, push-to-talk recording, voice note cards, and sophisticated animation system.
- **Achievement**: 
  - ✅ Implemented VoiceNote data model with Codable support
  - ✅ Built VoiceNotesViewModel with AVAudioRecorder integration
  - ✅ Created push-to-talk RecordingButton with haptic feedback
  - ✅ Designed VoiceNoteCard with staggered layout and waveform visualization
  - ✅ Implemented StaggeredGrid for card arrangement
  - ✅ Built complete ContentView with NavigationView and empty state
  - ✅ Added 3-minute recording limit with progressive warnings
  - ✅ Implemented vibration alert at 10 seconds remaining
  - ✅ Created ProcessingCard with recording/processing states
  - ✅ Built sophisticated animation system for voice note insertion
  - ✅ Fixed animation timing: ProcessingCard appears on press, not release
  - ✅ Ensured stable cards during recording (only ProcessingCard animates)
  - ✅ Added error handling and minimum recording duration
- **Lesson Learnt**: Animation timing is crucial for UX - users need immediate feedback when they start an action, not when they finish it. Isolating animations to active elements prevents visual clutter. SwiftUI's Combine framework requires explicit imports. Using spring animations with proper dampening creates more natural motion. ProcessingCard should show different states (recording vs processing) with appropriate visual indicators.

### VL0004
- **Time**: 21:55
- **Date**: 2024-06-28
- **Vibe Summary**: Implementing complete voice recording and playback functionality. Enhanced VoiceNotesViewModel with audio playback capabilities and redesigned VoiceNoteCard with bottom-right play button placement for better UX.
- **Achievement**: 
  - ✅ Integrated AVAudioPlayer with VoiceNotesViewModel for audio playback
  - ✅ Added proper NSObject inheritance and AVAudioPlayerDelegate conformance
  - ✅ Implemented play/pause functionality with single-note playback limit
  - ✅ Created real-time playback progress tracking with visual indicators
  - ✅ Enhanced VoiceNoteCard with play/pause button and progress visualization
  - ✅ Added waveform color animation during playback showing progress
  - ✅ Implemented percentage progress display and proper haptic feedback
  - ✅ Added audio session management for recording and playback modes
  - ✅ Built file existence checking and error handling for missing audio files
  - ✅ Improved card layout by moving play button to bottom-right corner
  - ✅ Reorganized duration/progress info into vertical stack on bottom-left
  - ✅ Successfully resolved compilation issues with proper imports and inheritance
- **Lesson Learnt**: VoiceNotesViewModel needed NSObject inheritance to conform to AVAudioPlayerDelegate protocols. UIKit import is required for haptic feedback generators. Audio session management is crucial for switching between recording and playback modes. Visual feedback (waveform progress, button scaling) significantly enhances user understanding of playback state. Bottom-right button placement follows mobile UX patterns for thumb accessibility. Swift delegation patterns require proper protocol conformance and delegate assignment.

### VL0005
- **Time**: 22:35
- **Date**: 2024-06-28
- **Vibe Summary**: Resolved critical TCC privacy violation crash by implementing proper iOS privacy permissions for microphone and speech recognition access. Successfully tested transcription functionality on iPhone 16e with iOS 26 beta.
- **Achievement**: 
  - ✅ Fixed TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) privacy violation crash
  - ✅ Added NSMicrophoneUsageDescription and NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription via INFOPLIST_KEY build settings
  - ✅ Implemented runtime permission request system in VoiceNotesViewModel initialization
  - ✅ Added permission checks before recording (microphone) and transcription (speech recognition)
  - ✅ Configured graceful fallbacks when permissions are denied by user
  - ✅ Resolved Xcode 16 Info.plist conflict by using auto-generated approach instead of manual plist
  - ✅ Successfully tested app on real iPhone 16e device running iOS 26 beta
  - ✅ Confirmed voice recording and iOS 26 SpeechAnalyzer integration works on actual hardware
- **Lesson Learnt**: 
  - **iOS Privacy Framework Evolution**: Privacy permissions in iOS have become increasingly strict, requiring explicit user consent dialogs and proper usage descriptions. TCC violations cause immediate app crashes.
  - **Xcode 16 Modernization**: New Xcode project format auto-generates Info.plist, requiring privacy keys to be set via INFOPLIST_KEY build settings rather than manual plist files.
  - **Simulator vs Device Reality**: iOS 26 beta simulators lack advanced ML capabilities like SpeechAnalyzer, but real devices have full functionality. Always test privacy-sensitive features on actual hardware.
  - **Permission Request Timing**: Privacy permissions should be requested early (app launch) rather than just-in-time to provide better user experience and avoid mid-flow interruptions.
  - **Beta Software Limitations**: iOS 26 SpeechTranscriber framework is only available on physical devices, not simulators, highlighting importance of device testing for cutting-edge features.
